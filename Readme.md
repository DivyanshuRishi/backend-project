I'm learning this from Hitesh Choudhary - [Watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fjOw8ApZ1I).

## Overview

This project is a YouTube-like application that allows users to upload, stream, and manage videos. The application consists of a backend API for handling data and a frontend interface for user interaction.
